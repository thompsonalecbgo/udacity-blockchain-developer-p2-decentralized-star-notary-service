Decentralized Star Notary Service Project

This project builds on the lessons in Udacity's Blockchain Developer Nanodegree on Ethereum Smart Contracts, Tokens and Dapps. It allows user to create unique stars. Users can then put the star up for sale, exchange them with other users, or transfer it to other users. The smart contract is deployed on the Rinkeby Network.
